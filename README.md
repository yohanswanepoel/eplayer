vueplayer
This is an electron based app that uses VUE and native disk access to play videos in a folder. I will add images and loop of that as well.

The project is mostly for me to explore cross platform apps using VUE.

Project setup
```
npm install
```
Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run start
```
Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run make
```
